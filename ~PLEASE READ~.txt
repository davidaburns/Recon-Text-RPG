Ok so i thought that it might be a good idea that before you commit your source
that you go and copy all of the current source (Before Commiting) into the Saved 
Source Code folder and then add your source into the Project Vanquish source folder

E.x.
You made changes to say VanquishEngine.cpp and a few changes in the Map.cpp

Copy all the content in Source Code->Project Vanquish Alpha v. 0.1.3.7
into Source Code->Saved Source Code

And then change the name of the Save Source Code to the current most updated revision (Before you commit)

then commit all of your edited source code into 
Source Code->Project Vanquish Alpha v.0.1.3.7

thank you ~Dave
