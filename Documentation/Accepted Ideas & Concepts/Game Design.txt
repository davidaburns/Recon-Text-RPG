“Vanquish”
By: David Burns (Makaze)



Introduction
      It has been 2000 years after the war of age, the portals connecting 
the two worlds of Eiden and together have been destroyed and lost since then. 
No one has even found the ruins of them. Until one day, The evil Emperor of Sage 
found the location of a new portal. Knowing what terrors lye beyond activating 
the portals the emperor tries with all of his power to find and activate that 
portal and unleash war and terror among the lands of Eiden.
 	It is your job to stop the evil emperor and destroy both the portal 
and the emperor along with it. You will travel among the lands of Eiden 
from town to town to the location of the portal, meeting new friends and 
making twice as many enemies along the way.
