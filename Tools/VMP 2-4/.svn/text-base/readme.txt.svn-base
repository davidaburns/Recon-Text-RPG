0.5. Startup

When you first startup the editor you will see the update screen
followed by input of the Map Width. This value must be between
the values specified on the screen and will determine how many
objects can be placed on the x axis. After pressing enter the
Map Height value will pop up. This value is the same as the 
first except it determines how many objects can be placed on
the y axis.

If you input an invalid value the editor will take it as a hacking
attempt and boot you off. After pressing enter on the Map Height
screen the editor program will begin.

1. Basic Toolbar Buttons

In Vanquish Map Editor 2 you will notice a nice little
toolbar that you can use instead of keyboard commands.
Here is a list of each button and a little description
of what it does. Every tool that you need to make good
maps has been included.

The Left Arrow - Scroll To The Left
The Right Arrow - Scroll To The Right
The Up Arrow - Scroll Up
The Down Arrow - Scroll Down

The Blue SV - This stands for save and is used to save
a map incase you wish to edit it in the editor later.
Simply click it and find where you want to save and do so.

The Purple LD - This stands for load and is used to load a
map that you previously saved. You will notice a default .vef
extension used on all maps in loading and saving.

The Green EX - This stands for export. Use this feature to 
export the map into a code file designed purposly for Vanquish
and Vanquish alone. After pessing the EX you will be prompted
to enter the map name. This will go inside the file you choose
to save to as [<Map Name>] ~ code ~ [END MAP] so get it like you
want it.

NOTE: If you export onto an existing file the editor will append into
the file rather than actually overwrite it.

The Cyan SO - You will now see this. Instead of using the left and
right arrow keys to select objects, simply click this to enter object
select mode. While in this mode, blocks will appear at the top left of
the screen. You may click a corrosponding block peice to select that object
then it will automatically re-enter map edit mode. You will be unable
to place objects while in object select mode, however you may still delete
objects.

DO NOT SCROLL WHILE IN OBJECT SELECT MODE!

3. Using The 'Scroll' Parameter

The 'Scroll' Parameter (seen on the toolbar) is a very unique system
created by Jake that allows you to know where you are on the map. Don't
worry, the editor will not allow you to scroll farther than the map width
and height you specified, however, this parameter is good for telling
where you are on the map and can be especially useful when editing larger
maps. The first value in the Scroll: (#, ?) is the x value of the map. This
represents a unique x established by the editor. When this value is "0" you
are as completely far LEFT on the map as you can go. The second value in the
Scroll: (?, #) is the y value of the map. This is also a unique y value
established by the editor. When this value is "0" you are completely as far
UP on the map as you can go. The default starting position is (0, 0)
- also known as TOP LEFT and when you export a map the editor will return
to this position as required by the exportation system.
