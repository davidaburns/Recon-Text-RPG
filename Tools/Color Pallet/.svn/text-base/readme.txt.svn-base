This is a color pallet that will display how ever
many colors you tell it to. Try inputting 5, then restart
and input 100 to see the difference.

The returned "Index" value is the value you put for
SetConsoleTextAttribute(HANDLE, #);
Where # = Index

to display the desired color in your console application.
To display colors you need the following code -->

// windows.h must be included to use HANDLE's
HANDLE hConsole = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE); // Set The Handle
SetConsoleTextAttribute(hConsole, #); // Set The Color
